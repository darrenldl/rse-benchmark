Benchmarking code for reed-solomon-erasure library

## Note
Sorry, because of personal reasons, I no longer want to work on collecting or plotting out the benchmarks. Unless someone is interested, this repo will not show any results. Many thanks to [lnicola](https://github.com/lnicola/) and [hexjelly](https://github.com/hexjelly), and apologies to them.

However, the `reed-solomon-erasure` library is still actively maintained.

## Contributors
Many thanks to the following people for testing and benchmarking on various platforms

[lnicola](https://github.com/lnicola/) (platforms : (Linux, Intel))

[hexjelly](https://github.com/hexjelly) (platforms : (Windows, AMD))

Their provided raw benchmarks are in `results/{user name}`.

lnicola's results will be pushed into this repo a bit later
